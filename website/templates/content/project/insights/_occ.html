<h6>Get people what they need&nbsp;quickly</h6>
<p>The Oregon Convention Center’s audiences fall clearly into three groups: visitors, exhibitors, and event planners. Each of these audiences needs to quickly find the information that is relevant to them, so we designed a prominent navigation bar that immediately guides people to the right area of content for&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>We also promoted a curated list of the most important links for each audience, so with one tap exhibitors could order services, planners could view floor plans, and visitors could find parking, for&nbsp;example.</p>
<p>We also identified a small number of resources that are so critical that everyone should be able to find them immediately. For example, parking in the busy Lloyd District can be tricky, so we promoted parking and a handful of other key links to the very top, and made them especially prominent on mobile. We know folks are trying to find where to park, so when they’re pulled over where they shouldn’t be, we give them that info as quickly as&nbsp;possible.</p>

<h6>I’m hungry! What can I&nbsp;eat?</h6>
<p>During Discovery, we learned that 40% of the convention center’s revenue comes from the rich and diverse concessions venues located throughout the building. However, the venue hours are inconsistent and confusing since they’re based on convention event times, so visitors were confused about what was open&nbsp;when.</p>

<p>Hungry and confused visitors are not happy visitors, and so we devised the idea of a one-tap “Eat Now” feature. We designed and built this feature and linked it to the convention center’s existing scheduling system, and now hungry convention-goers can pull out their phone and with one touch find delicious food near&nbsp;them.</p>
<h6>OCC is people</h6>
<p>We met the staff at the convention center, and it turns out the OCC has a truly passionate, friendly team of people, eager to give personal help and attention. When we saw their enthusiasm we recognized this as both a part of the OCC brand and also an opportunity to extend their service&nbsp;online.</p>
<p>We highlighted staff faces and direct contact info on the pages each person is responsible for. We also implemented real-time web chat for all team members, meaning an exhibitor who has a question about the event service offerings can immediately start chatting with an event manager without even picking up a phone. Chat operators can then answer questions, or even interactively guide the person to the right place to find information on the&nbsp;website.</p>
