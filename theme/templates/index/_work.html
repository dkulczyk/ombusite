            OMBU was honored to develop Paramount Pictures current website.
            This important site features a clean and light design implemented
            with a responsive front-end that automatically adjusts to
            smartphones, tablets, and desktop users. The site makes use of
            cutting-edge HTML5 technologies such as push-state navigation,
            video, and 3D transformations. OMBU's role in the project included
            technical planning, platform and infrastructure development, and
            the migration of Paramount’s extensive movie database. Site design

            OMBU planned and developed a customized CMS for the five schools
            of the University of Oregon's Lundquist College of Business.
            The College needed a powerful publishing and moderation
            system capable of delivering its message in a forward-looking
            design that could reach their wide audience, on any device. We
            delivered a solution that not only met these requirements, but
            leveraged and extended existing University systems, such as their
            calendar and single sign-on solutions, so this shiny new website
            remained a good neighor in the University's web infrastructure. Site
