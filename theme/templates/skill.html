                <ul>
                    <li>Drupal is mature, robust, and can handle sites of any
                    size, and specification.</li>
                    <li>Drupal is popular and proven. In most cases, niche or custom
                    solutions are hard to maintain in the long-run.
                    <li>Drupal is Open Source and works best with Open Source
                    technologies. More of your budget goes to making
                        things work exactly how your orgainzation needs.</li>
                    <strong>Drupal has a large, established, &amp; fantastic
                        community</strong>.</li>

                    establish weekly winners.</li>

                    long-time client <a href="http://www.evosus.com">Evosus</a>
                    launch a support portal for their customers. The portal was
                    offered through the Evosus website, but the backedn used
                    Evosus' exiting support tools and workflows.</li>

                    an e-book writing and publishing platform where authors and
                    editors could collaborate in the writing and editing of
                    textbooks. The platform is able to output the book as XML, a
