When TriMet emailed me to explain that I had not been selected as a beta user for [their new mobile ticketing app](http://trimet.org/mobiletickets/), I decided to publish my disappointment on Google Plus.  I uploaded a quick screen capture of TriMet's message, allowed Google Plus to attach my location, and wrote a single, dejected word in the content of the post:

![Lame.](http://snaps.ombuweb.com/googleplus_trimet-20130509-135743.jpg)

A couple days later, I used Google Maps to plan a new cycling route from work to home.  To establish the origin of my route, I searched for "OMBU."  The company's street address and Google profile appeared as the first result.  I noticed that OMBU now showed "1 review."

![This is my alt text](http://snaps.ombuweb.com/OMBU_WEB%2C_107_SE_Washington_St_%23136%2C_Portland%2C_OR_-_Google_Maps-20130509-134458.jpg)

I quickly discovered that Google had interpreted my checked-in Google Plus post from a few days earlier as a _review_ of OMBU and associated it with the business profile accordingly.  That was goofy enough on its own, but then I clicked the review link to see how it would appear.  My cheeks flushed red when I read my apparent one-word review of OMBU: **Lame**.
