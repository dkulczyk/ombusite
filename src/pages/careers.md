------------------------------------------------------

OMBU is a dynamic and well-rounded technology firm where full-stack developers
play an essential role. We put an emphasis on identifying and implementing the

Sencha Touch, Bootstrap, AWS, and Fabric.

We're currently looking for a developer comfortable working across the full Web
stack. The ideal candidate will be a constant learner who thrives designing and
implementing solutions to technical challenges with the support of a team. If
you think you may fit the bill, or would like to learn more, let's chat!

  architecture, and infrastructure.

  designing and shipping large-scale and high-quality solutions.
- Exposure to a wide range of clients, projects, and industries, including

  which you'll have a large stake in the solution and implementation.

  balance, remote-work, and flexible schedules.
