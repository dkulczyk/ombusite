Company Overview
-------

OMBU is an Open Source Software technology expert specializing in designing and implementing enterprise CMS, custom
applications and cloud hosting infrastructures. We've designed, built, and maintain some of the largest sites on the
Web, from Portland State University's multi-site platform with 100+ sites, Paramount Pictures' site with 3000+
requests/second at peak times, and NPR's Car Talk with a community of over 35,000 users.

OMBU team members thrive in small, pragmatic teams, with well defined processes but a high degree of independence.
Succeeding at OMBU requires passion for the Web, self management skills, commitment to the team and a getting-it-done
attitude. OMBU is a true collaborative team and it is not unusual for the whole team to be involved in a project at some
point or another.

dozens of globally distributed content editors, sometimes a CRM for an online academy, other times a custom LMS for a

product, but an elegant solution that will excel in its functions and delight users.

- Excellent team collaboration skills (soft and hard)
- Ability to thrive in a low management environment

### Benefits
