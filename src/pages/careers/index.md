Pictures' site with 3000+ requests/second at peak times, and NPR's Car Talk with
a community of over 35,000 users.

Our clients choose us because we approach their projects with an open mind and 
design unique and innovative solutions tailored to their needs and 
goals. And, while we're passionate about working with the latest technologies,
 we remain laser focused on our client's needs and goals, to deliver product 
 on time and budget that will advance our client's goals and attract attention
  to their organizations. 

OMBU team members thrive in a small, pragmatic teams, with well defined 
processes but few other rules and policies. Succeeding at OMBU requires self 
management and commitment to our team and clients, and a *getting 
it done* attitude to focus effort where the most value lies. We don't have 
individual rock stars. OMBU is a true collaborative team and it is not 
unusual for the whole team to be involved in a project at some point or another.

  portfolio of happy clients.

  entertainment, education, NGOs, and government, each with unique technical
  challenges.

  results and puts a strong emphasis on life/work balance.
