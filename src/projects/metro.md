OMBU planned and developed a customized CMS for the five schools
of the University of Oregon's Lundquist College of Business.
The College needed a powerful publishing and moderation
system capable of delivering its message in a forward-looking
design that could reach their wide audience, on any device. We
delivered a solution that not only met these requirements, but
leveraged and extended existing University systems, such as their
calendar and single sign-on solutions, so this shiny new website
remained a good neighor in the University's web infrastructure. Site
