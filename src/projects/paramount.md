summary: Mynydd Mawr is an outlier of the Moel Hebog group and is situated between Snowdon and the Nantlle Ridge. It's not very high - 698m or 2269ft, but because of it's position the views from the top are spectacular.

OMBU was honored to develop Paramount Pictures current website. This important
site features a clean and light design implemented with a responsive front-end
that automatically adjusts to smartphones, tablets, and desktop users.
