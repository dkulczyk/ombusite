summary: Mynydd Mawr is an outlier of the Moel Hebog group and is situated between Snowdon and the Nantlle Ridge. It's not very high - 698m or 2269ft, but because of it's position the views from the top are spectacular.

OMBU was honored to develop Paramount Pictures current website.
This important site features a clean and light design implemented
with a responsive front-end that automatically adjusts to
smartphones, tablets, and desktop users. The site makes use of
cutting-edge HTML5 technologies such as push-state navigation,
video, and 3D transformations. OMBU's role in the project included
technical planning, platform and infrastructure development, and
the migration of Paramount's extensive movie database. Site design
